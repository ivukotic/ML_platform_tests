    "In High Throughput Computing, one is typically faced with having to manage a large set of computational tasks. This can include situations in which tasks may depend on one another. Workflow management systems can help relieve job management burden for you, the user. \n",
    "[DAGMan](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.5/2_10DAGMan_Applications.html) (Directed Acyclic Graph Manager) is a workflow management system based on graphs (see figures below) build into HTCondor. \n",
    "DAGMan handles sets of computational jobs that can be described as a set of nodes in a [\"directed acyclic graph\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph). This means that the job dependencies do not form a loop, see \"Cyclic\" vs. \"Acyclic\" figure below. \n",

    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to apply DAGMan to help us manage jobs and job interdependencies. First, we will revisit the optimization example from in the previous section. Second, we will manage a set of molecular dynamics (_MD_) simulations using the [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) program. NAMD is conventionally used in highly parallel HPC settings, scaling to thousands of cores managed by a single job. One can achieve the same scaling and ease of management in [HTC systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_computing) using thousands of individual jobs using workflow tools such as DAGMan. \n",

    "## Running Jobs with DAGMan\n",
    "\n",
    "DAGMan offers an elegant and simple solution to reduce the management burden on you (the user) if you have more than a handful of jobs to run or there are jobs that dependent on each other. For example, if you have a set of jobs that may take longer than 2-3 hours to complete, a subset of your jobs may be terminated prematurely. Managing the resubmission of prematurely terminated jobs manually is not practical in most cases. DAGMan tracks which jobs were terminated prematurely, and allows you to resubmit the terminated jobs with one command. Similarly, if you have a set of jobs that depend on each other in some way, DAGMan has the functionality to allow you define these dependencies and manage them for you.\n",

Say for example, in our workflow of four linear jobs, the jobs `A0` and `A1` finished, `A2` failed, and `A3` is incomplete. In such a case, we do not want to start executing the jobs all over again but rather we want to start from `A2`. This information is embedded in the rescue DAG file. In our example of `linear.dag`, the rescue DAG file would be `linear.dag.rescue001`. We re-submit the DAG:\n",

    "One additional feature of DAGMan is that you are able to tune how many total jobs to have sitting in the queue or how fast jobs are submitted to the cluster. This is especially important if you have fairly large number of jobs, i.e. more than 10000. HTCondor can handle up to 200000 jobs in the queue simultaneously, but only on dedicated and specialized hardware. To accomodate other users on the OSG Connect system and reduce stress on the system, we recommend that you keep less than 30000 jobs in the queue in the idle state. \n",
    "\n",
    "DAGMan can be configured to allow you operate within those limits. The simplest way is to pass a text file with your configuration parameters to `condor_submit_dag`: `condor_submit_dag -config dagman.config your_dag.dag`. The configuration file will look something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_IDLE=30000\n",
    "DAGMAN_USER_LOG_SCAN_INTERVAL=1\n",
    "DAGMAN_MAX_SUBMITS_PER_INTERVAL=10\n",
    "```\n",
    "`DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_IDLE` tells your DAGMan job to limit the maximum number of jobs that are sitting in the queue to be 30000. `DAGMAN_USER_LOG_SCAN_INTERVAL` tells your DAGMan how often to look for a changed job state, i.e. that a job failed or completed. `DAGMAN_MAX_SUBMITS_PER_INTERVAL` is to tune how many jobs DAGMan submits every interval. The last two variables are for tuning how rapidly and how many jobs are submitted.
